URL Browser is a experimental little app written in AppleScriptObjC that controls Safari with AppleScript.

It is possible to get the current url of safari. Numeric parts of the url can be selected with the mouse. 
With up/down buttons the numeric part is counted up or down. Safari loads the page with the new url.

In case of urls of pictures only this is very helpful. With another button it is possible to save the
loaded image in Safari to a specified location.
